# Reminder-Desktop-Notifications
Code for setting up reminders which will show up as Desktop Notifs [For Windows 10 only]

To run the code and setup a reminder: 
* Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
* The ```win10toast``` and ```time``` libraries have been used in the code. You need to have them too. 
* Now, ```time``` is a part of Python's standard library. It is installed along with the rest of Python. 
* However, you still need to get ```win10toast```, unless you have it already. For that, type in your terminal: 
``` 
pip install win10toast 
```
Okay, you are good to go!

Type this in your terminal and follow the prompted instructions:

```
python Reminder&Alarms.py
```
